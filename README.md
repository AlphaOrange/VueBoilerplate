# Vue 3 + Vite + vue-router + Pinia + PureCSS + PHP Auth

Boilerplate for future Vue3 projects. This boilerplate contains

- Basic website setup including Home view (logged out and logged in), Imprint view, Login and register view
- Three page layouts: Full screen, Page with max-width and centered box
- Basic components: Login and Register Forms, Navigation bar, tabbed panel
- Basic styling based upon Pure CSS
- Routing with vue-router (with Web Hash History)
